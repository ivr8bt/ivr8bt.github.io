# [Project 1: Machine Learning on Califonia Lupus Epidemiology Study Dataset](https://github.com/ivr8bt/CLUES-ML)
I ran 9 different supervised learning algorithms on the California Lupus Epidemiology Study (CLUES) to distinguish active from inactive disease. These included Naive Baye's, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Adaboost, Gradient Boosting Classifier, K-nearest neighbor classifier and SVM. The Decsion Tree was found to be the best model and achieved an accuracy of 85% as well as a specificty of 95% and precision of 92% on the test set. Feature selection using Gini importance showed the top features for predicting disease activity, which was very notable in this case since figuring out the top features for predicitng disease activity is more imrotant than the model since model's predicting SLE will often be limited. This is a paper that I authored but the code is not available since it is proprietary information of AMPEL Biosolutions. However, the results and methodology can be obtained [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10503349/).

# [Project 2: CNN Pre-built Architecture Analysis](https://github.com/ivr8bt/CNN-Architecture-Analysis)
I analyze the LeNet5, VGG16, InceptionV3 and ResNet50 architectures on 4 different datasets: Cifar10, Cats vs. Dogs Redux: Kernel addition, Eurosat and Horses vs. Humans. Each of these datasets involve different kinds of comparison. 2 are multiclass and 2 are binary classification problems. The datasets also have different image sizes and numbers of images. I found that VGG16 and InnceptionV3 performed the best across all 4 datasets. InceptionV3 was overall the best since it had comparable accuracy to VGG16 with an average accuracy of 86% across the four datasets; however, it was significantly faster than VGG16.

# [Project 3: Classification of MNIST Images](https://github.com/ivr8bt/MNIST-Classification)
Classification of MNIST data using Deep Neural networks of various sizes and nodes. Train set of 60,000 and test set of 10,000 images. Greatest accuracy on the test set was 0.979.

# [Project 4: Classification of News Data using AG News Dataset](https://github.com/ivr8bt/AG-News)
Classification of AG News dataset into business, sports, science/tech and world news using simple RNNs, LSTMs and GRUs. Train set of 114,000 articles, validation set of 6,000 articles and test set of 7,600 articles. Able to achieve 86% test accuracy on test set.

# [Project 5: EDA on European Covid Dataset](https://github.com/ivr8bt/European-Covid-2020-2022)
Data analysis on European Covid data from 2020 through 2022 using R. I conducted exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, explored correlation and conducted autoregression. I looked at the rate of covid incidence and infection among all European countries and then focused in on France and Germany to identify trends in infection and incidence rates over time in the two countries.

# [Project 6: EDA on UNHCR Refugee Data](https://github.com/ivr8bt/UNHCR-Refugee)
Exploratory Data Analysis examining refugee flows 1975-2021 using data from the UN High Comissioner for Refugees. I identified the top countries where refugees flee from and where they go to by decade as well as cumulatively.

# [Project 7: Regression on Ames Housing Dataset](https://github.com/ivr8bt/Ames_Kaggle)
Regression on Ames Housing Dataset on Kaggle. Utilized random forest regression, gradient boosting regression and ridge regression. Achieved results in the top 10% of Kaggle scores.
